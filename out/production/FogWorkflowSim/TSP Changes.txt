Sim extension log:
- Energy computed for each layer. Previously was only for the mobile layer
- To specify a random´s seed
- Energy computed by device and not by layer
- To find the placement place
- To avoid the placement in mobile layer
- To add a new fog device to simulate the gateway and leave it out of the scheduling
- Simulate the scheduling & placement time //Postponed
- Change data source (including the new features) //HERE
- Add the new schedulers





My guidelines:
- My changes are commented stating with "TSP Change"


Notes: in the scheduling to keep out the vm0 on fog layer to gateway and to manage the scheduling with the others. And see it and gateway
