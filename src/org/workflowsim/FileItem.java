/**
 * This is a file implementation in WorkflowSim. Since CloudSim has already
 * implemented File, we call it FileItem here. The reason it is here is
 * WorkflowSim has a different view of files. Case 1: in org.cloudsim.File, file
 * size is integer, while in our case it should be double sine we have many big
 * files. Also, we would like to precisely estimate the transfer delay. Case 2:
 * we would like to specify the type (input, output, intermediate) which is a
 * different concept to the type in CloudSim.
